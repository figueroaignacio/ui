# NachUI

## NachUI is an independent, open-source collection of clean, minimal, and professional UI components — created by Ignacio Figueroa.

It’s not a library, not a package, and nothing needs to be installed.
Every component is designed to be copy-paste, dependency-free, and easy to customize.

## 🚀 What is NachUI?

NachUI is a curated set of UI components built with:

- React
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (for subtle and elegant animations)

The goal is simple:

- Give developers fast, beautiful UI components without adding new dependencies or installing anything.
- Each component is handcrafted with a focus on:
- Simplicity
- Readability
- Accessibility
- Great developer experience
- Just open the component, copy the code, and paste it into your project.

## 🤖 AI-Powered Chatbot (Groq SDK)

### NachUI includes an integrated AI-powered chatbot inside the documentation site.

It is built using the official Groq SDK, offering ultra-fast inference and a smooth developer experience.
The chatbot’s purpose is to:

- Assist users with questions about NachUI
- Provide guidance on how to copy, use, and customize components
- Offer quick help related to React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion
- Explain best practices and usage patterns
- Deliver clean, concise answers based on the project’s philosophy
- The assistant runs entirely client-side within the docs UI and serves as an example of how developers can integrate AI tooling into modern user interfaces using NachUI components.
- This makes NachUI not only a component collection, but also a practical reference for building real-world AI-driven features with the Groq SDK.
