    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "Is NachUI an npm library?",
        "answer": "No. NachUI is not a traditional npm package. It is a copy-paste design system. This gives you full control over the code without external dependencies that can become outdated or limit you."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes NachUI different from other component libraries?",
        "answer": "Unlike libraries like MUI or Ant Design that work as black boxes, NachUI provides the complete source code. No hidden abstractions—you see and modify everything. No breaking changes—you decide when to update. No limitations—you're not tied to others' design decisions. A complete Design System with tokens, patterns, and guides, not just components."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use NachUI in commercial projects?",
        "answer": "Yes, absolutely. NachUI is free and open source. Use it in personal or commercial projects without restrictions. The code is yours once you copy it."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I update components if there are new versions?",
        "answer": "Since the code lives in your project, you control updates. Selectively copy improvements, keep your customized version, or use the CLI to compare and merge changes. No forced npm updates breaking your app."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need design knowledge to use NachUI?",
        "answer": "No. NachUI includes a complete, coherent design system ready to use. Design tokens, colors, spacing, and components are professionally crafted. Use them as-is or customize to your needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does NachUI work with Next.js, Remix, Vite?",
        "answer": "Yes. Built with React, it works with any modern framework: Next.js (App & Pages Router), Remix, Vite, Astro, and more. You just need React 18+ and Tailwind CSS."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does it work with AI tools like Cursor or Claude?",
        "answer": "NachUI is AI-native. Since the code is open and visible in your project, AI tools can read, understand, and modify it directly. They can suggest edits based on your patterns, generate new components, and work without 'black box' confusion. It enables seamless human-AI collaboration."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the components accessible?",
        "answer": "Yes. All components follow WCAG and WAI-ARIA guidelines: full keyboard navigation, proper ARIA attributes, screen reader support, color contrast, and visible focus states. Accessibility is fundamental, not optional."
