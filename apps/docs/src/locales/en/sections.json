    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "Is NachUI an npm library?",
        "answer": "No. NachUI is not a traditional npm package. It's a Design System based on copy and paste code directly into your project. This gives you full control over the code without external dependencies that can become outdated or limit you."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes NachUI different from other component libraries?",
        "answer": "Unlike libraries like MUI or Ant Design that work as black boxes, NachUI delivers the complete source code. This means: No hidden abstractions - You see and modify all the code. No breaking changes - The code is yours, you decide when to update it. No limitations - You're not tied to other people's design decisions. Complete Design System - Not just components, but tokens, patterns, and guides."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use NachUI in commercial projects?",
        "answer": "Yes, absolutely. NachUI is completely free and open source. You can use it in personal, commercial, client projects, or any other type without restrictions. The code is yours once you copy it to your project."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I update components if there are new versions?",
        "answer": "Since the code lives in your project, you control the updates. You can selectively copy improvements that interest you, keep your version if you've already customized it, or use the CLI to facilitate comparison and merging of changes. There's no forced npm update that breaks your application."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need design knowledge to use NachUI?",
        "answer": "No. NachUI comes with a complete and coherent design system ready to use. Design tokens, colors, spacing, and components are already professionally designed. You can use them as they are or customize them according to your needs."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does NachUI work with Next.js, Remix, Vite?",
        "answer": "Yes. NachUI is built with React and works with any modern framework that supports it: Next.js (App Router and Pages Router), Remix, Vite, React Router, Create React App (Not recommended for obvious reasons), Astro with React integration, and any other React setup. You just need React 18+ and Tailwind CSS."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does it work with AI tools like Cursor or Claude?",
        "answer": "NachUI is designed with AI in mind. Being open source and completely visible: AIs can read and understand the entire implementation, they can suggest modifications based on your actual code, they can generate new components following your existing patterns, and there are no black boxes that confuse models. It's the future of development: humans and AI working on the same code."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are the components accessible?",
        "answer": "Yes. All NachUI components are designed following WCAG and WAI-ARIA guidelines: Full keyboard navigation, appropriate ARIA roles and attributes, screen reader support, adequate color contrast, and visible focus states. Accessibility is a fundamental principle, not an optional feature."
