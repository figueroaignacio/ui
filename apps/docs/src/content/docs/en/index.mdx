**NachUI is not just a set of components. It is your own Design System—open, transparent, and fully under your control.**

Unlike traditional libraries that rely on closed packages or hidden abstractions, NachUI is **Open Source** and **Open Code**.  
This means the code is yours from the very first moment: visible, editable, and free of artificial barriers.

Conventional libraries work… until you need something different. Then come the wrappers, style overrides, and hacks that break consistency.  
NachUI removes that pain by giving you **the actual source code**, along with **design tokens** and design patterns you can extend without limits.

The Design System is built on these fundamental principles:

- **Full Ownership**: The code, tokens, and patterns live inside your project. Nothing is hidden.
- **Open Source — Open Code**: Every line is transparent, editable, and auditable.
- **Unified Design Language**: All components follow the same visual and compositional rules.
- **Simple Distribution**: A CLI and a structured schema system make adding or creating components effortless.
- **Production-Ready**: Modern, accessible, and cohesive values from day one.
- **AI-Native**: Clear patterns, standardized code, and structured documentation built for AI tools.

## Full Ownership

When you add a component from NachUI, the source code becomes part of your project.

This means:

- **Absolute Transparency**: You can inspect, audit, and modify everything.
- **Total Freedom to Modify**: Change APIs, styles, or internal structures without restrictions.
- **AI Integration**: Since it’s Open Code, your models can understand, optimize, or extend components without barriers.

Instead of adapting to another library’s limitations, you work directly with the code you actually need.

## Unified Design Language

NachUI defines a solid foundation of **design tokens**, composition patterns, and visual rules that apply across the system.

This ensures:

- coherent APIs
- consistent styles
- uniform accessibility
- predictable behavior

Even external integrations follow the same design language, ensuring true cohesion across your interface.

Your team learns one system.  
Your AI learns one pattern.  
Everything works together.

## Simple Distribution

NachUI includes a system designed to scale with your projects:

- **Component Schema**: Defines dependencies, tokens, and internal structure.
- **Smart CLI**: Install components with a single command. The code is copied directly into your project.
- **Extensible**: Create your own collections and maintain your own visual ecosystem.

Whether using manual workflows or AI-assisted flows, everything naturally fits your Design System.

## Production-Ready

Components come ready to use from day one:

- **Professional Aesthetic**: Minimal, modern, and highly adaptable.
- **True Visual Consistency**: Everything is designed as a system—not as isolated pieces.
- **Easy Customization**: Modify tokens, styles, or props without fighting the library.

You get a solid foundation without starting from scratch, but with the full control only an Open Source project can offer.

## AI-Native

NachUI is built for the era of assisted development:

- Open, readable, standardized code
- Repeatable patterns that AI can follow with zero ambiguity
- Documentation tailored for both humans and models
- Natural workflow to generate new components based on your style

By being Open Code, AI can extend your Design System without breaking its coherence.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordion type="multiple" className="mt-6" defaultValue="faq-1">
  <AccordionItem value="faq-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>Is NachUI an npm library?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      No. NachUI is not a traditional npm package. It's a Design System based on **copy and paste** code directly into your project. This gives you full control over the code without external dependencies that can become outdated or limit you.
    </AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="faq-2">
    <AccordionTrigger>What makes NachUI different from other component libraries?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Unlike libraries like MUI or Ant Design that work as black boxes, NachUI delivers the complete source code. This means:

      - **No hidden abstractions**: You see and modify all the code
      - **No breaking changes**: The code is yours, you decide when to update it
      - **No limitations**: You're not tied to other people's design decisions
      - **Complete Design System**: Not just components, but tokens, patterns, and guides

<AccordionItem value="faq-3">
  <AccordionTrigger>Can I use NachUI in commercial projects?</AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    Yes, absolutely. NachUI is completely free and open source. You can use it in personal,
    commercial, client projects, or any other type without restrictions. The code is yours once you
    copy it to your project.
  </AccordionContent>
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="faq-4">
    <AccordionTrigger>How do I update components if there are new versions?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Since the code lives in your project, you control the updates. You can:
    
      - Selectively copy improvements that interest you
      - Keep your version if you've already customized it
      - Use the CLI to facilitate comparison and merging of changes

      There's no forced "npm update" that breaks your application.

  </AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem value="faq-5">
  <AccordionTrigger>Do I need design knowledge to use NachUI?</AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    No. NachUI comes with a complete and coherent design system ready to use. Design tokens, colors,
    spacing, and components are already professionally designed. You can use them as they are or
    customize them according to your needs.

  <AccordionItem value="faq-6">
    <AccordionTrigger>Does NachUI work with Next.js, Remix, Vite?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Yes. NachUI is built with React and works with any modern framework that supports it:

      - Next.js (App Router and Pages Router)
      - Remix
      - Vite
      - React Router
      - Create React App (Not recommended for obvious reasons)
      - Astro with React integration
      - And any other React setup

      You just need React 18+ and Tailwind CSS.

<AccordionItem value="faq-7">
  <AccordionTrigger>How does it work with AI tools like Cursor or Claude?</AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    NachUI is designed with AI in mind. Being open source and completely visible: - AIs can read and
    understand the entire implementation - They can suggest modifications based on your actual code
    - They can generate new components following your existing patterns - There are no "black boxes"
    that confuse models It's the future of development: humans and AI working on the same code.
  </AccordionContent>
</AccordionItem>

  <AccordionItem value="faq-8">
    <AccordionTrigger>Are the components accessible?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      Yes. All NachUI components are designed following WCAG and WAI-ARIA guidelines:
     
      - Full keyboard navigation
      - Appropriate ARIA roles and attributes
      - Screen reader support
      - Adequate color contrast
      - Visible focus states
    
      Accessibility is a fundamental principle, not an optional feature.
