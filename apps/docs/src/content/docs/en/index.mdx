**This is not an npm library. This is how you own your component layer.**

Traditional component libraries ask you to install dependencies and import pre-built components. This works until you need something different. Then you're stuck writing wrappers, overriding styles, or piecing together incompatible solutions.

I7A UI takes a different approach. Instead of abstracting components behind packages, it gives you the actual code. You install, customize, and own every component in your project.

The kit is built on these core principles:

- **Direct Ownership**: Component code lives in your project. No black boxes.
- **Unified Design**: Every component follows the same patterns and works together seamlessly.
- **Simple Distribution**: A CLI and schema system makes adding components effortless.
- **Production-Ready**: Carefully crafted defaults mean you ship faster without sacrificing quality.
- **AI-Native**: Open code that AI models can read, modify, and enhance.

## Direct Ownership

When you add a component from I7A UI, the source code becomes part of your project. This means:

- **Complete Visibility**: See exactly how each component works under the hood.
- **Freedom to Modify**: Change anything to match your requirements. No workarounds needed.
- **AI Collaboration**: Your AI tools can read and improve your components directly.

Traditional libraries force you to work around their abstractions. With I7A UI, you simply edit the code you need to change.

## Unified Design

Every component in I7A UI shares consistent patterns and APIs. Whether it's a button, dialog, or data table, you'll find familiar interfaces and predictable behavior.

This consistency extends to third-party integrations. When we bring in external functionality, we adapt it to match the I7A design language and composition patterns.

Your team learns one way of building. AI models learn one pattern to follow. Everything works together.

## Simple Distribution

I7A UI includes a distribution system built for modern development:

- **Component Schema**: A clear structure defining each component, its dependencies, and configuration.
- **CLI Tool**: Install components with a single command. Works across different frameworks.
- **Extensible**: Create your own component collections using the same schema.

The system is designed for both manual use and AI-driven workflows. Generate new components that automatically integrate with your existing setup.

## Production-Ready

I7A UI components ship with thoughtful defaults:

- **Clean Aesthetics**: Modern, minimal design that looks professional immediately.
- **Consistent System**: Components are designed as a cohesive family, not isolated pieces.
- **Easy Customization**: Override defaults through standard CSS and component props.

You get high-quality UI without starting from scratch, but with full freedom to adapt to your brand.

## AI-Native

I7A UI is built for the age of AI-assisted development:

- Open source code that AI models can analyze and understand
- Consistent patterns that make code generation reliable
- Documentation structured for both humans and AI

Your AI tools can suggest improvements, generate variants, or create entirely new components that fit naturally into your design system.
