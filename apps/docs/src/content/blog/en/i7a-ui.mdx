After months of refining patterns, composing interfaces, and reusing ideas from my own projects… I wanted to turn all that creative chaos into something clearer, more organized, and scalable.

**That’s how I7A UI was born:**  
an open design system and an _open source / open code_ component kit — **inspired by tools like shadcn/ui, Base UI, Radix UI, and Hero UI** — built with Tailwind + Framer Motion and designed specifically for React and Next.js.

It’s not a library.  
It’s not an npm package.  
It’s not magic.

It’s real code. For you to copy, paste, modify, and own.

## What makes I7A UI different?

### Full Ownership

You don’t install a package or rely on black-box abstractions.  
Every component lives inside **your** codebase.  
You see it, touch it, and modify it.

If something doesn’t fit your needs, you simply change it — without fighting someone else’s constraints.

### A Unified Design Language

All components share the same visual and technical foundations:

- consistent APIs
- cohesive styles
- predictable patterns

No more mixing pieces that don’t truly fit together.

### Copy, paste, and build

It uses tools we all rely on:

- clsx
- class-variance-authority
- tailwind-merge

Integrating a component is as easy as copying a file and using it.

### A Structure That Scales

Components are organized to grow alongside your project:  
clean, modular, and designed to work together without friction.

### Production-ready Animations with Framer Motion

Each component includes refined animations: smooth, elegant, and performant.

### An Indie Project

I7A UI isn’t trying to be “the next big library.”  
It’s an independent, honest project built out of love for frontend development.

No company behind it. No marketing.  
Just code, design, and the desire to share something useful.

### AI-Friendly by Design

The codebase is clear, consistent, and structured — perfect for any AI tool to:

- generate variations,
- suggest improvements,
- or create new components that follow the same system.

## Why did I build it?

First, because it was fun.

Second, because I was tired of reinventing buttons, modals, and layouts from scratch.

Third, because I wanted speed, consistency, and a visual identity of my own.

And finally, because I prefer a system **I** control, rather than depending on another package living on npm.

I7A UI is my way of creating a real, flexible, accessible, and fully open design system.

This is just the beginning. ✨
