After months of refining patterns, composing interfaces, and reusing ideas from my own projects… I decided to turn all that work into something more structured.

**This is how I7A UI was born:**
an open-source component kit inspired by shadcn/ui, base-ui, Hero UI, and built with Tailwind + Framer Motion, designed specifically for React and Next.js projects.

It isn’t a library.  
It isn’t an npm package.  
It isn’t magic.

It’s real code — copy it, paste it, and fully own your component layer.

## What makes I7A UI different?

### Direct Ownership

You don’t install a package, and you don’t depend on black boxes.  
Each component lives inside your project.  
You see it, touch it, modify it.  
If something doesn’t fit your needs, you simply edit it.

### Unified Design

All components follow the same patterns:  
consistent APIs, coherent styles, and predictable behavior.

No more mixing solutions that don’t really work together.

### Copy, paste, and go

Many components use the tools we rely on every day:

- clsx
- class-variance-authority
- tailwind-merge

So integration is easy, fast, and natural.

### Simple Distribution

Just add the component and it instantly becomes part of your project, with a structure designed to scale.

### Framer Motion Animations

Animations are integrated with an elegant style, keeping both aesthetics and performance in mind.

### An Indie Project

I7A UI isn’t trying to be “the next big UI library.”  
It’s an indie, open, honest project built with love for frontend development.

### AI-Native

The code is clean, structured, and consistent—ideal for AI tools to:

- generate variants,
- suggest improvements,
- or create brand-new components that follow your design system.

## Why I built it

Because I was tired of reinventing buttons, modals, and layouts in every project.  
Because I wanted speed, consistency, and a personal design style.  
And because I prefer owning my code instead of depending on a package that lives on npm.

I7A UI is my way of creating a real, flexible, and fully open design system.
